## Why VimSanity

We wanted to make learning vim motions as simple as possible, for that stubborn friend of yours who you've been trying to convert since forever now.

Here is the idea:

- Straight to the point.
- Discover motions on your own.
- Satisfying and easy to understand.
- As true to vim motions as possible.

Unlike other tools designed to learn Vim, VimSanity abstracts Vim motions away from code editors. This approach makes the learning process more beginner-friendly, especially for those who think that learning Vim is intimidating, or dare I say, insane...

## What is VimSanity?

VimSanity transforms Vim's sometimes intimidating learning curve into an engaging experience where you can:

- Learn essential Vim commands through hands-on practice
- Navigate through text using Vim-style commands
- Master search functionality that mimics the real Vim experience
- Track your progress with a scoring system
- Complete challenges to reinforce your skills

## Why Learn Vim?

Vim's modal editing approach might seem strange at first, but once mastered, it offers unparalleled efficiency for text editing. VimSanity helps you develop these skills in a low-pressure environment before applying them in real coding scenarios.

No more feeling lost when you accidentally enter Vim! With VimSanity, you'll transform from a Vim novice to a navigation pro.
